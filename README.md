ClearMail Landing Page Documentation
Project Overview
ClearMail is a responsive landing page built for a smart email cleaning service. The main goal of this project was to showcase a product that helps users organize their inboxes, remove spam, and manage emails efficiently. The design focuses on clarity, simplicity, and modern UI, making it easy for users to understand the product at a glance.
Tech Stack Used:
•	Next.js – for building a fast and scalable React-based website
•	Tailwind CSS – for styling with ready-to-use utility classes
•	Vercel v0 – used to generate UI sections and components quickly

What’s Included in the Project
The landing page includes all the essential sections that make a product website look complete:
1.	Navbar – A simple top navigation bar to guide users.
2.	Hero Section – The first thing users see. Includes a catchy heading, a short description of the product, and a call-to-action button.
3.	Features Section – Shows 3 main features of ClearMail:
o	AI Spam Detection
o	Smart Categorization
o	1-Click Unsubscribe
Each feature is displayed as a card with a short description.
4.	Testimonials – Highlights real user experiences to build trust.
5.	Pricing Section – Shows Free and Pro plans with the features included in each.
6.	Contact Section – A simple form for users to get in touch with the team.
7.	Footer – Contains contact info, social media links, and copyright information.

Design & Responsiveness
•	Built mobile-first, so it works perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops.
•	Cards, buttons, and text scale smoothly depending on the screen size.
•	Hover effects and subtle animations make the site feel interactive and modern.
•	Used Tailwind CSS for rapid styling, so everything is clean and consistent.





Vercel v0 Contribution
I used Vercel v0 to quickly generate the structure and layout of key sections:
•	Hero section design with gradient background and CTA button
•	Features section cards
•	Testimonials layout
•	Pricing cards
•	Footer structure with social media icons
After generating these, I customized styles and hover effects manually using Tailwind CSS.

Conclusion

Vercel v0 helped speed up development by generating high-quality UI components, which were then customized to match the ClearMail brand.
